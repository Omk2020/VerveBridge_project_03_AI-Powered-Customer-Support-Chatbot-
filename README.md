AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis and Real-Time Query Resolution

This project focuses on building an AI-driven chatbot capable of resolving customer queries in real-time using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot integrates external APIs, performs sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction, and utilizes a machine learning-based recommendation system for personalized responses.

Key Features:

	•	NLP and Sentiment Analysis: Uses spaCy, BERT, or GPT for language understanding and emotion detection.
	•	Real-Time Query Resolution: Integrates APIs like OpenAI and Google Knowledge Graph for accurate and instant answers.
	•	Recommendation System: Provides product or service suggestions using ML and Deep Learning algorithms.
	•	Continuous Learning: The system improves over time with feedback and retraining.

Technologies Used:

	•	NLP Libraries: spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, GPT).
	•	APIs: OpenAI API, Google Knowledge Graph API.
	•	Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.
	•	Visualization: Tableau, Power BI.
